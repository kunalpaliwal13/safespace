Introduction

The  Wellbeing  Service  offers  support  for  people  who  are  experiencing  difficulties 
with depression, low mood, anxiety, worry, stress or panic. This workbook has been 
designed to be used whilst attending one of our Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) 
Skills workshops or with support from your Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner (PWP). 

Low mood, anxiety, worry, stress and panic can affect many people at different times in 
their lives. It may be a one-off occurrence or may reoccur on several occasions. It can 
be a very frightening, unbearable and lonely experience. It can feel as if it will never 
get any better. It may have taken some time to realise that you are struggling with your 
mood. 

The aim of this workbook is to introduce you to a number of tools that will help you build 
up your own ‘toolkit’ to help manage your current symptoms of depression or anxiety 
and maintain progress towards long-term recovery. The tools covered in this workbook 
are based on the principles of evidence based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.

CBT looks at how your thoughts, physical feelings, emotions and behaviours are all 
interlinked and have an impact on each other. CBT uses practical strategies to help 
you make changes which are more positive and realistic. It is very important for you to 
put these strategies into practice as the more you put in, the more you get out of CBT.

You will notice as you read through the workbook that there are a number of exercises 
for you to complete. Try and work through these activities spending more time on those 
that seem more useful to you and your current problems. Speak with your PWP if you 
experience any difficulties with the techniques.

Tool 1: Understanding Depression

What is depression or low mood?

Depression is a distressing experience. Physical symptoms of low mood can affect the 
way that we think, what we do and how we feel. This can then spiral into a vicious cycle, 
making it harder to cope, to do the things that we used to do, our thinking continues to 
be negative or unhelpful. This then reinforces how low we feel physically and mentally.

Our thoughts can be very negative when we’re depressed. We can be unkind and critical 
of ourselves. We might overgeneralise or catastrophize, we might jump to conclusions, 
we might think that we know what other people are thinking (mind reading). We can 
find it very difficult to see anything positive in our situation, only the bad. We might even 
think that our feelings are indeed facts. We can feel quite hopeless about the future.

Research  has shown that the main causes for low mood can be linked to genetics, 
biology, early difficult experiences in life, ongoing stress or life events. Different factors 
contribute  to  people’s  depression  but  the  symptoms  are  very  common  to  all.  It  is 
thought that a combination of low serotonin (a chemical within the brain), inactivity and 
unhelpful thoughts all lead to depression. Some say it is the body’s way of saying we 
need to do something about this.

We tend to default to negative thinking when we are depressed. We may think that 
other  people  do  not  like  us.  We  may  withdraw  from  work  or  social  activities.  In  the 
short term is easier to cope with not seeing people or going out. On top of that we may 
have difficulties sleeping, or eating well. We may feel guilty if we are irritable or grumpy 
towards our friends and family or if we overeat. Thoughts such as ‘what’s the point’ 
may make it difficult to motivate ourselves to get up and dressed. 

When experiencing depression we can also have thoughts about harming ourselves 
or others. We can think that life is not worth living, wishing that we did not wake up or 
may have fleeting thoughts about harming or killing ourselves. These kinds of thoughts 
are a quite common symptom of depression and it can be frightening. If these thoughts 
become unmanageable and you feel suicidal please see your GP urgently, call 111, call 
the Mental Health helpline on 01438 843322, or attend your nearest A&E. Contacting 
these services will enable you to receive the more immediate support needed to help 
you overcome this.

Your GP may have prescribed you antidepressants to help you feel better by reducing 
some of the symptoms of depression. Talk to your GP or PWP if you have any questions 
about how to manage your medication. By using the CBT techniques within this booklet 
we hope to help you make those life changes to enable recovery.

Tool 1:  Understanding Anxiety 

What is anxiety?

Anxiety is a range of normal though unpleasant emotions. We can feel worried, nervous, 
uneasy, or we can feel extreme fear, panic or terror. Appropriate levels of anxiety are 
actually a helpful survival mechanism. Anxiety is designed to alert us to a situation that 
we need to respond to, if we do not respond there are usually negative consequences, 
we could be in danger or under threat.

These situations might include feeling anxious about an exam or presentation at work, 
for which we can respond to by preparing and practicing for. Anxiety also can be more 
sudden and acute in some circumstances such as when we are about to cross the road 
and we hear the beeping of a car before we step out. Our response is to jump out of 
the way to safety.

These  examples  highlight  how  anxiety  provides  the  driving  force  behind  motivation 
and keeps us safe from harmful situations. In this way anxiety is similar to physical 
pain. Pain keeps us safe from harm by telling us to remove our hand from a hot flame. 
Anxiety keeps us safe by ensuring we appropriately respond to dangerous, difficult or 
threatening situations. If we did not experience physical pain or anxiety how safe would 
we be?

The fight or flight response

The  biological  process  that  underpins  anxiety  is  called  ‘the  fight  or  flight  response’. 
This response comes from the time our prehistoric ancestors when we relied heavily 
on our ability to fight or run away to survive (when confronted with a dangerous animal 
for example). In today’s world we rely on anxiety less for these reasons, there aren’t 
many  sabre  tooth  tigers  wandering  around  Hemel  Hempstead  or  St Albans,  but  the 
response still remains.

The fight or flight response is triggered when we perceive danger and the body prepares 
by  releasing  a  chemical  called  adrenaline.  See  the  table  below  for  how  adrenaline 
affects us.

Physical symptoms of anxiety

Reasons why we experience this 

Dizziness, breathlessness, tightness in 
chest

Breathing gets quicker, so more oxygen 
can reach muscles

Heart pounding, palpitations,

Heart beats faster, blood pressure up to  
pump blood to the muscles

Visual disturbance

Vision sharpens 

Muscle tension, wobbly legs, shaky

Muscles ready for action

Sweating more 

To maintain effective body temperature, 

Tingling or numbness, pins and needles Calcium discharged

Feeling sick, dry mouth, butterflies in 
stomach, feelings of choking

Unable to concentrate,   

Feeling like you need to go to the toilet 

Blood is diverted to major muscles 
so digestive and saliva production is 
reduced.

As mind focuses on threat – alert to 
danger, filters out other non-threat 
factors

Sphincter muscles tighten – close the 
opening of our bladder and bowels

Tool 1:  Understanding Panic

What is panic? 

Panic  attacks  are  an  extreme  form  of  anxiety.  It  is  not  harmful  but  it  is  incredibly 
unpleasant, usually as they are unexpected. Many people have been so terrified by 
having a panic attack that they call an ambulance as they have felt and feared that they 
were ‘losing control’, ‘having a heart attack’, ‘going to suffocate’ or ‘going to die’. Panic 
attack can be even more frightening if you have a long-term health condition such as 
asthma or COPD. 

We often recognise panic as a problem when we are having recurrent attacks and are 
concerned about any further attacks. For others panic can seem to occur ‘out of the 
blue’. We can also have night time panics which affect our sleep. We may also avoid 
certain situations where we feel the panic attacks occur, such as busy places. 

Physical symptoms include an accelerated, sometimes doubled, heart rate, shortness 
of breath, sweating, and nausea. These symptoms usually peak within 5 to 10 minutes 
(as  our  bodies  cannot  maintain  these  symptoms  for  very  long).  However  this  feels 
prolonged,  and  it  can  be  a  repetitive  cycle  occurring  many  times  during  the  day  or 
night. We are exhausted afterwards as our bodies recover.

We  overestimate  the  physical  symptoms  of  the  anxiety  we  are  experiencing  in 
that  moment  and  feel  that  it  can  harm  us  and  is  extremely  dangerous.  We  call  this 
catastrophic  misinterpretation.  The  vicious  cycle  of  panic  can  then  spiral  as  we 
focus on symptoms and our thoughts become more distressed, we feel as though we 
cannot cope and our worse fears will happen. 

See below for some common symptoms and fears when experiencing panic.

Physical symptoms of panic or 
extreme anxiety

Possible catastrophic 
misinterpretation or fear

Dizziness, breathlessness

I’m going to faint

Heart pounding, palpitations, tightness 
in chest

I’m having a heart attack

Visual disturbance

I’m losing it, I’m going blind, I have  
brain tumour

Wobbly legs

I’m going to faint 

Tingling or numbness

I’m having a stroke or I have a brain 
tumour.

Feeling sick, dry mouth, butterflies in 
stomach

I’m going to be sick 

Unable to concentrate

I’m losing it

Feeling like you need to go to the toilet 

I’m going to have an accident, lose 
control of my bowels and bladder

Shortness of breath, trembling

I’m going to suffocate, I can’t breathe

This type of anxiety can also cause us to become more hypervigilant, which can lead 
to further misinterpretation of bodily symptoms and cause further anxiety, and panic.

The Vicious Cycle of Panic:

We may also find ourselves engaging in ‘safety seeking behaviours’. These are usually 
short-term  solutions  which  artificially  reduce  anxiety  and  continue  to  maintain  the 
problem and can lead to continued avoidance. 
These behaviours also mean that we do not give ourselves an opportunity to see we 
would be able to cope without them. 

Some  safety  seeking  behaviours  include:  Carrying  a  water  bottle,  a  paper  bag, 
medication, taking someone with you, having headphones on listening to music all the 
time.

Some people have been told to carry a paper bag or when feeling anxious concentrate 
on breathing, this is not helpful when learning to overcome panic.

Tool 1:  Understanding Worry

What is Worry?

We all experience worry from time to time. This can sometimes be helpful for us as it 
can help us to get a job done, for example, worrying about an interview can help us to 
prepare for the interview (this is referred to as productive worry). However, sometimes 
our worry can “take over” and stop us from getting things done (this is referred to as 
unproductive worry). We may also notice that our worries “jump around” and so we 
worry  about  lots  of  things,  including  minor  concerns. This  may  mean  that  we  rarely 
solve our worries but keep moving onto our next worry. It is quite exhausting.

Worry can be unhelpful for us when we worry about things that are:

•

•

•

Uncertain – Nothing in life is certain. So if we search for something that is certain 
we will have to keep searching or accept that we will not find it. 

An example of this can be when trying to be certain that we will be healthy. We 
may continuously worry about our health and check our body to make sure we 
are ok.  

Unpredictable – We do not know what will happen in the future. Worrying about 
this can stop us from enjoying the present. 

An example of this can be worrying about our family’s safety.

Uncontrollable – We cannot always control the situation and the people around 
us. Worrying about this can also stop us from experiencing the present. 

An example of this can be worrying about how someone will react to you at 
work/pub/home; this may stop you from doing a particular activity.

When  our  worry  jumps  around  and  when  we  are  worrying  about  something  that  is 
uncertain, unpredictable, and/ or uncontrollable we may then notice feelings of anxiety. 
When  this  happens,  it  is  common  that  we  experience  worry  about  worrying.  When 
we  have  been  worrying  for a  long  time, this  may  also  lead  us to feel  less  confident 
and  may  reduce  our  self-esteem,  affect  our  sleep  and  have  an  impact  on  our  jobs, 
relationships and health.  

We  also  experience:  tension  headaches,  irritability,  fatigue,  difficulty  concentrating, 
muscle aches, and sleep problems. We can then start worrying about our health, the 
health and wellbeing of our friends and family, this is then very tiring, affects our sleep 
and makes us tearful and sad. This is the vicious cycle of worry.

Please continue to work through the workbook as we will build on the knowledge you 
have learnt. By practicing some of the techniques in your own time as well as in session, 
you will overcome the difficulties that you are presently experiencing.

Tool 2: The ABC
A Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 
Based Approach

What is CBT?

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can help people look at the different situations 
that they find themselves in, and to understand their thoughts, physical sensations and 
behaviours. The idea is that our thoughts, physical symptoms and behaviour can all 
influence one another and therefore contribute in maintaining unhelpful moods such as 
low mood and anxiety. Take a look at the diagram below.

Situation

Autonomic
(Physical Symptoms)

Cognitions 
(Thoughts)

Behaviours
(What we do)

CBT  emphasises  that  it  is  not  necessarily  the  situation  that  causes  the  emotional 
distress  that  an  individual  experiences,  but  rather  it  is  the  individual’s  interpretation 
or  view  of  that  situation  that  leads  to  this.  CBT  works  by  learning  how  to  challenge 
negative thoughts and learning how to change unhelpful behaviours.

When  feeling  low  or  anxious,  it  is  common  to  have  Negative Automatic  Thoughts 
(NATs).  These  are  unhelpful  thoughts  that  pop  into  our  minds  without  any  effort. 
With  anxiety,  NATs  are  often  about  overestimating  threat  and  underestimating  an 
individual’s ability to cope, which can maintain anxiety. Sometimes people find coping 
mechanisms which help them deal with the situation. This may involve avoiding the 
situation,  or  doing  something  differently  to  help  control  their  anxiety. Although  this 
may lower their anxiety in the short term, it can actually maintain and reinforce it in 
the long term. Breaking this vicious cycle may cause an increase in anxiety to begin 
with but ultimately help reduce it.

The example below is of Lynda, who experiences anxiety when going to the shops. 
She notices her heart pounding, breathing difficulties and feeling hot. She thinks “I’m 
having a heart attack,” which further contributes to her physical symptoms. As a result, 
she is now avoiding going to the shops, or escaping from them as quickly as she can. 
This can cause Lynda to feel even more anxious when next faced with this situation 
and will also strengthen her unhelpful thoughts. Her thoughts, physical symptoms and 
behaviours are all influenced by each other.

Lynda’s ABC

Situation: Going to the shops

Autonomic
Heart pounding, difficulty 
breathing, hot and 
pains in chest

Cognitions 
“I’m having a heart 
attack”

Behaviours
Escapes from the Shops or 
avoids going altogether

With low mood, people tend to think about themselves, the world and the future in 
a  very  negative  way.    For  example,  someone  may    think  “I  am  useless”  and  “It  is 
pointless trying, as there is no point”. The lower a person feels, the more NATs they 
will have.  Naturally, the more NATs, the lower a person will feel. This forms a vicious 
circle that needs to be broken.

Look at the example below of Mike.  Mike has been having problems at work and over 
the last few months has been feeling very low. As a result, Mike has been withdrawn 
and not spending as much time with others, especially his family. He recently received 
a phone call from his mum, who Mike thought was not being sympathetic. This left 
Mike thinking ‘No-one cares about me’. Again, notice how his thoughts, behaviours 
and physical sensations are all influenced by each other.

Tool 3: Setting a Goal

In order for any self-help to be effective, it is important to set some SMART goals. They 
are important as they help us monitor our progress which helps further motivate and 
energize. They are also a reminder of what you are working towards which means you 
are more likely to stay on track.

Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Relevant
Time Limited

Self-Help is like a Road Map

Imagine you’re planning a journey and you are looking for directions. 
Is it possible to get directions to a destination that you do not know 
yet?

In the same way if you do not have any goals, how do we know what 
techniques to use to help you reach your goals?

Self-help goals can be either short term, medium term or long term. Long term goals 
may take years to achieve whereas short term goals may be achievable in a matter of 
weeks. When thinking of self-help goals, it may be a good idea to start breaking down 
the steps in order to create some short or medium term goals. 

Once you have created your goals, you start your journey towards recovery. It can be 
useful getting help deciding on the destination and which route you are taking. Once 
the journey has started, it’s up to you to practice working through the new techniques 
learnt to reach your destination.

Let’s look at some examples of SMART goals:

Whilst I am looking for a job, I would like to call 3 prospective employers 
each week and ask them about any vacancies. 
I would like to be able to do this within the next 3 weeks.

I would like to meet a friend for a drink 2 times a week and spend 30 
minutes with them. I would like to achieve this within the next 3 months.

I would like to learn how to better control my worrying so that I do not 
always jump to negative conclusions. Instead of worrying about things 
all day, I would like to allocate 20 minutes a day to worry. Throughout 
the day I will write down all my worries then refocus and worry about 
them at the allocated time. I would like to achieve this by the end of the 
month.

Let’s look at some examples of goals which are NOT SMART:

I would like to feel less anxious.

I would like to stop avoiding things.

I would like to do the things I used to do.

Review

Taking time to review goals at regular periods can help determine how helpful they are 
and if they are producing results. 

Things to consider:

Are you managing to meet your goals?

Do the goals need to be adjusted if they aren’t regularly completed?

Are your goals helping in the ways you thought they would?

Are there other potential problems and solutions you need to consider?

Have your problems or triggers changed?

Remember that there is not one ‘correct’ way to complete tasks.  

Remind yourself that improvement can be gradual, which is normal and 
to be expected. 

Prioritise time to practice the techniques and complete tasks so that you

Tool 4: Lifestyle Changes

Healthy Eating

Everyone should aim to have a healthy and balanced diet. There are many advantages 
to healthy eating, including a reduced risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.

Many of us consume more calories than we need to. If we are consuming more calories 
than we burn we are likely to put on weight. The amount of calories we need to consume 
depends on how active we are. 

The average adult male needs around 2,500 calories per day and the average adult 
female needs around 2,000 per day. 

In order to have a balanced diet it’s important to eat a wide variety of foods so that you 
are receiving all the nutrients you need. Check out below, some tips which can help 
you achieve a healthy, balanced diet. 

Don’t skip Breakfast

It  is  often  stated  that  breakfast  is  the  most  important  meal  of  the  day,  and  it’s 
understandable why! Eating breakfast can help with weight control and is an important 
part of a balanced diet. Wholemeal cereal is often recommended (with sliced fruit) as 
a nutritious start to the day. 

Five portions of Fruit and Vegetables

At least five portions of fruit and vegetables are recommended each day. Things such 
as  unsweetened  fruit  juice  and  vegetables  cooked  into  meals  also  count.  Consider 
having fruit in the morning with your breakfast or some fruit for a healthier snack option. 

Eat more fish

Try to have two portions of fish (such as cod, haddock or tinned tuna) a week. Fish 
contains  proteins,  vitamins  and  minerals  which  are  helpful  in  maintaining  a  healthy 
diet. Oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and fresh tuna) have omega-3 fats 
can help to prevent heart disease, so try to include this at least once a week.

CBT Skills Training Book

25

Wellbeing Services

Include starchy foods 

Foods  such  as  potatoes,  pasta,  bread,  rice  and  cereals  should  make  up  around  on 
third  of  your  diet. Try  to  incorporate  this  into  your  main  meal  if  you  can. Also  try  to 
choose wholegrain options when available, as these contain fibre which can help you 
to feel full for longer. 

Reduce fat and sugar intake

Try not to eat foods that are too high in saturated fats. These types of fats can increase 
the risk of heart disease. Where possible use vegetable oil or reduced-fat spread rather 
than butter or lard. Also try to have lean cuts of meat, and cut off any visible fat where 
possible.

Where  possible,  instead  of  saturated  fats,  eat  food  such  as  oily  fish  and  avocados 
which contain unsaturated fats.

Try  to  reduce  sugar  intake.  Watch  out  for  drinks  which  are  high  in  sugar  (including 
alcoholic drinks) as these can often be contributing to weight gain.

Whilst there are naturally found sugars in foods such as fruit and milk, it’s helpful to 
limit foods such as cakes, pastries, fizzy drinks and biscuits which have added sugars. 
Check packaging to make sure that you limit these types of foods as much as possible.

Reduce salt intake

Too much salt can raise blood pressure, so make sure that you don’t add too much 
salt to your food. Make sure to check food labels, as salt is already in a lot of food 
we regularly consume. Some foods such as bacon, cheese and salty fish are more 
obviously high in salt. However many are not as aware that foods such as breakfast 
cereals, condiments, soup and bread that contain varying levels of salt also. 

When checking labels if there is more than 1.5g of salt per 100g, this means it is high 
in salt. Try not to have over 6g of salt each day.

Be active 

Regular physical activity can be helpful in trying to lose, or maintain healthy weight. 
You  can  achieve  regular  activity  through  regular  exercise,  or  utilising  other  ways 
of  incorporating  regular  activity.  This  includes  making  sure  that  if  you  find  yourself 
sedentary for long periods of the day, try making sure you are active when possible. 
This could be using the stairs instead of taking the lift, or parking your car further away 
than usual and walking to your destination.

Around 30 minutes of exercise five days a week is often recommended, so get this in 
when you can. You can ready further information on being active and exercising later 
on in the workbook.

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids

Try to drink around 1.2 litres of water, milk or fruit juice each day. Where possible, avoid 
fizzy drinks that are high in sugar. Make sure to increase fluid intake during warmer 
periods of weather or when undertaking physical exercise.

Tool 4: Lifestyle Changes

Exercise

Increasing physical activity has a number of health benefits. Not only can it help to lose, 
or maintain a healthy weight, but it can also help to reduce the risk of heart disease, 
stroke and type-2 diabetes.

Being healthy and increasing our health levels can be achieved by introducing 
or increasing levels of physical activity and muscle-strengthening activity.

The  Department  of  health  recommends  150  minutes  (2  hours  and  30  minutes)  of 
moderate-intensity  activity  each  week,  or  alternatively,  75  minutes  of  vigorously 
intensity activity. 

Examples of Moderate-intensity activities include:

Fast walking   

Hiking

Cycling 

Volleyball 

Skateboarding

Basketball

These  types  of  activities  will  increase  your  heart  rate,  breathing  and  make  you  feel 
hotter. The 150 minutes can be broken up into 30 minutes of activity 5 days a week.

Examples of vigorous-intensity activities include:

Jogging or running   

Swimming fast

Sports such as football, tennis or rugby   

Football

Fast cycling (or cycling around hills) 

Tennis

Aerobics and gymnastics 

Martial arts

These types of vigorous activity will leave you breathing hard and fast. Your heart rate 
will have increased and you may find it difficult to say more than a few words without 
catching your breath. 

Examples of muscle-strengthening activities:

Lifting weights 

Push-ups and sit-ups

Yoga   

Heavy gardening

Muscle-strengthening activities are in repetitions and sets. One push-up counts as a 
repetition and 8-12 of these are recommended to complete a set. Try to do 2-3 sets if 
possible. Muscle-strengthening activities are most beneficial if completed to the point 
where you struggle to complete another repetition.

Getting a Better Night Sleep

Here are some tips for how you can improve your sleep

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•
•

Don’t go to bed unless you are sleepy.  Read a book, listen to soft music or browse 
through a magazine. Find something relaxing, but not stimulating. 

Watching TV or using electronic devices (tablets, computers or mobile phones) is 
best avoided at bed time. Not only can the light they emit delay the onset of sleep, 
but it can also be too stimulating.

If you’re not asleep after 15 minutes then get out of bed. Find something else to do 
which will make you feel more relaxed. Once you feel sleepy again, go back to bed.

Begin a routine that helps you relax each night before bed. This could be a warm 
bath, getting into your pyjamas or reading away from your bedroom.

Go to bed and get up at the same time. This helps the body to recognise a routine 
for sleep. Do this on weekends and holidays.

Avoid taking naps. If you must take a nap, try to limit this (less than half an hour). 
Otherwise this reduces our need for sleep when it comes to our evening routine.

Keep a regular schedule. Regular times for meals, medications, chores and other 
activities help to keep the inner body clock running smoothly.

Only use your bedroom for sleep and sex.  Don’t read, write, eat, watch TV, or use 
any electronic devices in bed. 

Try to limit caffeine as much as possible and at least 4 hours before bedtime (this 
includes tea, coffee and even chocolate).

Do  not  have  a  cigarette  or  any  other  source  of  nicotine  before  bed  as  this  is  a 
stimulant. 

Do not use alcohol  to help with sleep problems. A common myth  is that alcohol 
helps you to sleep, but in fact it actually has a detrimental impact. Whilst it might 
help us get to sleep initially, it often disrupts sleep later in the night.

Don’t go to bed hungry, but don’t eat a big meal near bedtime either

Sleeping  pills  are  a  short-term  solution  only.  They’re  not  usually  prescribed  for 
long-term use due to side effects. If you are considering stopping the use of sleep 
medication, consult your GP first.

Have  a  pen  and  paper  or  worry  diary  next  to  the  bed. You  can  then  write  down 
anything making you feel anxious, so it can be dealt with the next day. 

Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, cool and that your mattress is comfy.

Avoid having clocks on display

“Get up if you can’t sleep”

•

•

•
•

If  you  are  in  bed  for  15  minutes  and  can’t  get  to  sleep,  then  get  up  and 
do  something  quiet  in  a  different  room.  Choose  an  activity  that’s  not  too 
stimulating and also make sure the lights are low. 

During this time avoid any activities which might be too stimulating. Try not 
to use any electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers or 
TV.

Do this until you feel sleepy, then go back to bed.

Repeat this cycle until you fall asleep in bed. This helps us to associate our 
bed with sleep.

Tool 5 - Increasing Activity Levels for 
Low Mood

Behavioural Activation

Low mood can affect people in different ways. It leads us to think more negatively, can 
affect us physically and even reduce our typical behaviours.

When we’re feeling low or depressed, any type of activity seems more difficult to do, 
so it’s common for people to become less active and stop doing some of the things 
they would normally do. We may find ourselves stop going out with friends, withdraw 
from family, put off housework and reduce engagement at work. Even activities that we 
usually enjoy can become a chore and these pleasurable activities are often the first 
we stop doing. Tasks that are important, or more difficult to accomplish like applying for 
a job, can become even harder to accomplish. 

By putting off these activities we get relief from not having to do them, and this relief 
negatively reinforces this unhelpful behaviour, as it encourages us to continue avoiding 
and reducing activities,  maintaining our low mood.

Avoiding these types of activities may seem helpful in the short-term, as we experience 
relief from not having to complete them. However, this avoidance means we may miss 
out on the positive experiences that may have occurred from doing the activity, such as 
seeing our friends, doing something we enjoy, getting something important completed 
or  spending  time  with  loved  ones. This  can  also  have  a  secondary  impact  on  other 
areas of our life, such as increased work absences, reduced productivity, or not getting 
something important completed on time. 

By not doing the activities that may have bought us pleasure or a sense of achievement, 
we miss out on possible positive reinforcement of these activities, leading to further 
reduction in helpful activities. 

Therefore, what is maintaining low mood is a circle of reduced activity. The technique of 
Behavioural Activation focuses on increasing the reinforcement of helpful behaviours 
and reducing the effects of unhelpful behaviours. Behavioural Activation aims to break 
this vicious circle by slowly integrating structured activities that will encourage us to 
continue to incorporate helpful behaviours in the future. It works by scheduling different 
types of activities and making sure that we follow the plan and not our mood so that 
we complete the activities, thus breaking the circle which can maintain low mood. Let’s 
look at these types of activities:

CBT Skills Training Book

31

Wellbeing Services

Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust

Routine Activities: These are regular types of activities we do often or every day, such 
as, waking up, general hygiene, cleaning the house, cooking etc.

Pleasurable Activities: These are the types of activities which we get enjoyment from, 
including hobbies, spending time with friends or family, going for walks, playing sport, 
going to the cinema etc.

Necessary  Activities:  These  are  the  types  of  activities  that  are  often  time  limited, 
and if are not carried out might lead to adverse consequences, such as paying bills, 
completing an important form, arranging car insurance etc. 

There is some overlap between these routine, necessary and pleasurable activities. 
Please try not to spend too much time trying to decide which category the task falls 
under, as long as it is included. The aim is to create a balanced increase in activities.

5 steps of Behavioural Activation

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Create a list of Routine, Necessary and Pleasurable activities – things you would 
like to be doing, things you may have stopped doing since you felt low

Create a hierarchy of the list you just made in step one – slot each activity in either 
easy,  medium,  or  difficult  in  the  hierarchy.  Make  sure  you  include  each  type  of 
activity – routine, necessary and pleasurable 

Schedule the activities using a blank activity diary – put in a mixture of activities.  
Start with the easiest activities first.  Small and regular activities can be best to start 
with and then you can build in other activities over time. Use SMART goals to make 
your activities detailed, for instance, to go for a ten minute walk with the dog every 
morning around 10 a.m. 

Do them! - do the activity. Remember, follow the plan and not the mood.

Review the week – review what activities you managed to include during the week.  
How did completing these activities impact your mood?  What other activities could 
you schedule in for the next week?  If it was difficult to complete some activities, 
think about why this was the case; were they too difficult?  What could you do next 
time? Break them down? Could you get a friend or partner to help you?

Step 4 – Complete the Activities. Make sure to follow the plan and not the mood! Do 
the activities you have scheduled even if you don’t feel like doing them.

Step 5 – Review the Week

Write down what activities you completed and what you learnt

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….

Ask yourself the following questions:

What impact did increased activity have on your mood?

Were any activities more helpful in making you feel better?

What will you include in next week’s activity schedule? (You may want to add some 
new more difficult activities, or you may want to increase some of the existing activities) 

Final Behavioural Activation Notes

Do not wait until you feel like completing an activity. When we’re feeling low it may take 
quite some time before we feel encouraged to do an activity, especially one which is 
quite burdensome. As a result, the behavioural activation technique encourages us to 
do the activity even if we do not feel like doing it. 

It may take some time for the effects of the behavioural activation technique to become 
apparent. This can be difficult, as the effects of relief received from reduced activity are 
more immediate. However, bear in mind the increase of unhelpful behaviours can have 
a secondary impact on our lives which can reduce our mood further. 

With  continued  use  of  the  behavioural  activation  technique,  you  should  see  an 
improvement  in  your  mood.  Make  sure  to  plan,  do  and  review  your  activities  and 
continue to use the technique for as long as you need.

Tool 6: Facing Your Fears

Graded Exposure

It makes sense for us to avoid the situations we fear as our anxiety quickly reduces. 
Whilst this may be helpful in the short-term, by avoiding situations that we are anxious 
about the level of anxiety will remain or increase around that situation. As we continue 
avoiding these types of situations, it makes it even harder for us to face these situations 
in the long-term.

There are two elements involved in anxiety; we overestimate the threat (for instance 
going on a rollercoaster, feeling dizzy and you think, ‘I will faint.)’ The other component 
to anxiety is that we underestimate our ability to cope with the threat (for example, ‘it 
will be awful and I won’t be able to cope’).

Our bodies have over learnt to keep monitoring and scanning for potential treats or 
triggers. These can be external, for example seeing a spider, and internal, noticing our 
heart beating faster. Whenever the body recognises a threat the fight or flight response 
is activated, and our body becomes physically prepared to respond to this threat. 

As a result, we need to help the body learn that the stimulus is not such a threat, by 
helping  to  cancel  out  when  it’s  not  needed.  The  CBT  technique  we  use  is  Graded 
Exposure. We will teach our bodies to overcome our fear by becoming habituated to 
the trigger or threat. For example when we get into a cold swimming pool on a hot day 
our bodies eventually adjust and it feels warmer even though the water temperature is 
the same. So we become habituated to the temperature of the pool if we stay in there 
for long enough. 

Graded Exposure 
helps to break this 
cycle of avoidance 
in manageable 
steps. By gradually, 
repeatedly, over 
time exposing 
you to these 
fearful situations 
without avoiding 
or escaping from 
them, or staying in 
the situation with 
our safety seeking 
behaviours. 

Look at this graph 
(right) which helps 
to demonstrate this;

CBT Skills Training Book

38

Wellbeing Services

Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust

The  graph  shows  that  by  avoiding  or  escaping  the  situation,  anxiety  levels  drop 
considerably. However, the next time the individual is put in the same situation, anxiety 
returns at the same level and will continue to do so if they continue to escape and avoid 
the situation. However, we can see that through using Graded Exposure, the anxiety 
will eventually reduce.

There are a few rules that come with the Graded Exposure technique. 

Exposure: The Four Rules

For Graded Exposure to be effective it needs to be graded, prolonged, repeated and 
done without distraction.

Graded

Overcoming a fear is best achieved by gradually confronting the fear. The steps must 
go from the least anxiety provoking to the most.  You need to gradually confront the 
feared  stimuli.  This  might  be  starting  with  situations  that  may  create  less  fear  than 
others,  or  objects  which  would  create  less  anxiety.  It  may  include  starting  off  by 
imagining  a  scenario,  looking  at  a  photograph  or  watching  videos  rather  than  going 
into the situation at the early stages.

Prolonged 

In order for Exposure to be effective, it must be prolonged. This means that each time 
we allow ourselves the time needed in order to experience the anxiety levels reducing 
naturally. This means staying in the situation for as long as it takes for the anxiety to 
reduce by at least half. For example, if someone stated that their levels of anxiety at 
the start of the exercise were 60% then they would need to stay in the situation until 
the anxiety reduced to at least 30%.

Repeated

In order to maintain progress, further exposure is needed. An exposure task should be 
repeated around four to five times a week if possible for maximum benefit. Each step 
will need to be repeated before moving on to the next step on the hierarchy. 

Without distraction 

When doing exposure it is important that people can experience some anxiety to see 
that it will reduce naturally.  Therefore, it is important that people do not do other things, 
or distract themselves with safety behaviors. This is also so your body learns it can 
cope without them.

Steps for Exposure

Step 1: 

Make a list of the objects or situations which cause you anxiety.

Step 2: 

Rank this list in order of difficulty from the least anxiety provoking 
to the most

Step 3:

Use this list to create your graded ladder for exposure.

Step 4:

Use your exposure diary to record your progress.

Start with the first step, and make sure that it’s not too difficult.

Each time you face a situation you will need to stay in it until your anxiety levels have 
reduced by at least half of what they were originally.

You will repeat each step at least four or five times in the same week if possible. Once 
you  are  able  to  better  cope  in  each  of  these  situations,  or  your  anxiety  before  the 
exercise has reduced, you can move on to the next step on your anxiety ladder. 

Remember expose without using distraction, relaxation or breathing exercises so you 
can feel the anxiety peak and reduce. We call these ‘safety behaviours’. 

When completing any exposure tasks, it may be helpful to keep an anxiety diary. This 
can  allow  you  to  rate  your  levels  of  anxiety  before,  during  and  after  your  exposure 
exercise. You  can  also  make  notes  or  write  down  any  of  your  thoughts  at  the  time. 
Please use the blank anxiety diary on the next page.

Tool 7: Containing Worry

Although a certain amount of worrying is normal, sometimes it can feel like our worry 
is becoming unmanageable. Containing Worry is about allowing yourself to worry as 
much as you like, but only at a specific time of the day that you will choose yourself. 
By following these steps you should notice an improvement in the amount of time you 
spend worrying and feeling more in control of your worry.

The  first  thing  we  need  to  look  at  with  worry  is  uncertainty.  It  is  often  these  types 
of  worries  we  need  to  contain.  If  we  find  ourselves  focusing  on  worries  where  the 
outcome is uncertain, we will soon find ourselves feeling overwhelmed, that things are 
out of control and this can have an impact on our lives. These worries can usually start 
with “what if…?”

On the other hand, some of the things we might find ourselves worrying about are the 
types of things we could deal with in the ‘here and now’. These are the types of things 
we should try to deal with there and then. 

As a result, when looking at worries, we’re looking at either hypothetical worries, which 
are based on uncertainty, or practical worries which we can deal with in the here and 
now. 

So when you have a worry, write it down and ask yourself the following;

Can I deal 
with this worry 
now?

Yes

Do it!

No
Write it down and 
contain it – Then 
worry about it 
later!

So, we’ve written the worry down, but what do we do now? Well follow these simple 
steps to try to contain your worry.

Step One: Make an appointment to contain your worry

Plan a short time for yourself to worry in (i.e. 8pm) and for how long for (i.e. 20 minutes).

This  time  will  vary,  and  perhaps  be  longer  at  the  beginning,  reducing  the  more  you 
practice the technique.

During this time you will not do anything else aside from worrying!

Don’t do this just before bed, or in the bedroom. Try and find a place where you can 
worry and where you will not be disturbed.

Try not to be distracted, make sure others are aware not to disturb you.

Step Two: Write down your worries 

When worrying outside your planned worry appointment, write down your hypothetical 
worries in a worry diary. 

If it’s a practical worry, you can deal with it there and then, or plan a suitable time to 
deal with this

Until you get used to identifying the difference between a hypothetical and a practical 
worry, use this worry diary to distinguish the two.

When  a  worry  occurs  write  these  worries  down  knowing  you  can  worry  about  it  as 
much as you want during the scheduled worry appointment.

Step Three: Refocusing on the Present

Once you have written down your worry, refocus on the present moment. Focus on 
what is going on around you and tune your attention onto it. It is harder to worry when 
you are really focused in the moment. Perhaps consider your five senses and focus 
on those. 
It  may  be  focusing  on  the  smell  of  the  cooking,  taste  of  the  food  you’re  eating,  the 
sound of the rain, the touch of a steering wheel and sight of a car in front of you.

This  is  not  about  distracting  ourselves;  it’s  about  bringing  us  back  into  the  present 
moment.

If  the  same  worry  comes  back,  or  new  ones  enter  your  mind,  write  them  all  down 
knowing  that  you  can  worry  about  them  as  much  as  you  want  during  your  worry 
appointment. Writing down the activity that you are going to focus on using the worry 
diary also helps you to ensure you refocus.

CBT Skills Training Book

46

Wellbeing Services

Repeat this process for any other worries that occur. If you find yourself slipping, make 
sure to remind yourself you will worry about these later on at the time you’ve designated 
and get back to focusing on your current activity.

Regular practice of worry time really helps you to manage your worries during the day.

Step Four: Scheduled appointment – Now Worry!

During the appointment you have allotted yourself, you can worry as much as you like 
about the worries you’ve written down.

Choose one you would like to start with and work from there.

You may find that these worries are no longer as strong as they initially seemed.

The urgency of the worries may have reduced.

We often find the worries are not as important or applicable as when they first occurred.
You can spend time reflecting on worries that are no longer an issue but this is not 
compulsory.

You  may  find  that  you  can  happily  reduce  your  worry  time  as  you  become  more 
practiced at the technique

Make sure you only worry about the worries you have wrote down that day in the worry 
diary. Any  new  worries  will  need  to  be  written  down  and  included  in  the  next  day’s 
worry appointment. 

At the end of your appointment, you stop your worry. Some people like to throw away 
their worry list for that day, each day starting with a fresh worry diary.

This technique takes practice and repetition. The more we practice this, the more our 
worries will reduce and this will help us to manage our worry better.

Continued practice of this technique may help you to find that you worry less outside 
of your designated worry appointment and feeling more able to manage your worries. 
If so, great!

Tool 8: Problem Solving

Although people who experience low mood or anxiety may worry about lots of things 
in general, sometimes what they are worrying about is a current, realistic worry and 
there may actually be a need to deal with this problem in a practical way. A problem 
solving approach can be used to help identify the problem and then try to find a way 
to manage it.

The following 7 steps can be used to solve a current problem:

1.  Identify the problem

2.  Identify all possible solutions

3.  Evaluate pros and cons

4.  Select a solution

5.  Plan

6.  Do (put the plan into action)

7.  Review

Top Tip

It is essential to write down your 
problem  solving  rather  than  just 
doing it in your head!

Problem Solving in Action

Imran was offered a job interview for next Thursday at 4pm but he was due to 
pick up his son from nursery at the same time. He started worrying about this 
and became anxious. He decided to try and use a problem solving approach to 
help with his situation.

6.

7.

Identify the problem – I have to be in two different places at the same time. I 
need to pick up my son and also attend a job interview.

I could ask my wife to pick up our son

Identify all possible solutions  – 
•
•
•

I could ask if any of my friends are free

I could call the employer and ask if the interview time could be changed

Evaluate pros and cons  – 
•

I could ask my wife to pick up our son – My wife might get angry, but she 
might be free and available.

•

•

I could ask if any of my friends are free – More chance of someone being 
free, but they might feel compelled to say yes.

I could call the employer and ask if the interview time could be changed – 
It might be possible to change the interview time but I don’t think it looks 
good to the prospective employer

I could ask my wife to pick up our son

Select a solution –  After thinking about the pros and cons, Imran ranked his 
solutions in the following order:
•
•
•

I could call the employer and ask if the interview time could be changed

I could ask if any of my friends are free

Plan – I can ask her when she comes home from work, after she has had 
something to eat.

Do (put the plan into action) – Imran asked his wife if she could pick up their 
son next week.

Review – Unfortunately Imran’s wife was not free to pick their son next week. 
She said that she may have been able to if she had been given more notice. 
Imran learnt that he may have to give people more notice in future. He decided 
to go to his next solution and called a few friends to see if they were free. One 
of them was and agreed to pick up his son. Imran attended the job interview 
but unfortunately did not get the job. However using this tool he feels he can 
cope if this situation arises again.

Tool 9: Cognitive Restructuring

Thought Challenging

Learning how to manage negative thoughts can help to manage your anxiety and low 
mood. When people are feeling low or anxious, their thoughts can often be extreme 
or  unrealistic.  Cognitive  Behavioural  Therapy  (CBT)  calls  these  types  of  thoughts 
Negative Automatic Thoughts or ‘NATs’. 

These NATs are the types of thoughts that would upset anyone. Although some people 
understand  that  their  negative  thoughts  may  not  be  true,  it  can  be  very  difficult  for 
people with anxiety or low mood to do this and they often take their negative thoughts 
as  fact.  Therefore,  this  type  of  unhelpful  thinking  can  continue  to  maintain  our  low 
mood or anxiety. 

How can challenging thoughts help me? 

The idea of this technique is not to just look at the positive side of things but to look at 
thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way.

More  balanced  thoughts  will  improve  your  mood  and  enable  you  to  function  better, 
which will result in enjoying your life again.

Initially you will need to write things down and follow the steps but through practice you 
can use this technique at the time of a difficult experience and hopefully improve your 
mood in the moment.

How this technique works

Our  thoughts  are  often  based  on  our  personal  opinion  and  experiences  and  not 
necessarily grounded in fact. There is also a negative bias to our thoughts when we 
are low or anxious. This can lead to us jumping to conclusions or thinking the worst 
about situations without any evidence for these thoughts being true. 

When challenging negative thoughts, we need to practice collecting evidence to see 
how accurate the thoughts really are. Factual evidence is much stronger then opinion 
as there isn’t any element of doubt. 

The idea is that we work with the thought which causes the most emotional distress, 
and  identify  to  see  how  much  truth  there  is  to  this  thought.  We  then  create  a  new 
alternative thought which is based on the evidence.

What is the difference between a thought and an emotion?

Thoughts  are  usually  a  sentence  or  statement,  about  something  or  someone.  An 
emotion is one word which describes how we feel. 

Examples of thoughts include:

“Nobody likes me”          

“Everything always goes wrong for me”

“If I am late for work, I will lose my job”          

“They think I’m stupid”

Examples of emotions include: angry, happy, anxious, depressed, etc.

There are 3 Steps in Cognitive Restructuring:

Step 1: 

Catching Thoughts

Step 2: 

Looking for the Evidence

Step 3:

Finding an Evidence Based/Alternative Thought

Step One: Catching Thoughts

Start by identifying a situation that has caused you to experience a strong negative 
emotion. 

•

•

•

First write details about that situation. It might not be the situation that caused the 
negative thoughts or emotions but by writing down details it will help you remember 
better what was going on.

Then write down all the different emotions and thoughts you were experiencing.   
For the each emotions rate how strongly you felt it, 0 (barely felt it) to 100% (very 
strongly experienced it). For each thought rate how much you believe it, 0 (don’t 
believe it at all) to 100% (very strongly believe it).

Next try and identify the “hot thought” in the situation. This thought is often rated 
the highest and most likely to be the cause of the negative emotion. It will have a 
rating of 60% or higher and match the negative emotion.

Catching negative thoughts can be difficult as it is often something that we are 
not used to doing. For that reason, you might need to practice this first stage a 
few times.

CBT Skills Training Book

55

Wellbeing Services

 
 
 
Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust

In  order  to  help  you  catch  your  thoughts,  ask  yourself  the  following  sorts  of 
questions:

What were you doing?          

What were you telling yourself?

Who were you with?      

What does it say about you if it’s true?

Where were you?      

What is the worst thing that went through your mind?

Some points to bear in mind when you are trying to catch your NATs:

•
•
•
•
•

They are short and specific   

They occur extremely quickly after the event

They can occur as words or images  

They seem reasonable at the time

They do not arise from careful thought or in a logical series of steps 

Step Two: Looking for the Evidence 

After catching your NATs, the next stage is to challenge the ‘Hot Thought’. 
•

Write down the evidence for and against the hot thought 

You are looking just for facts not opinions.

Think of this a little like being a prosecution and defence counsel in a court hearing. 
Evidence will be given from both sides to find the truth.

To help you when you are looking for evidence, you might want to ask questions such 
as:

•

•
•
•
•

•

If my friend or someone else was having this type of thought, what would I say to 
them?

If I wasn’t anxious or low, how would I look at the situation?

Is there any other way of looking at the situation?

What is certain about this situation?

If I believe this thought to be 80% true, what is the 20% that suggests I don’t believe 
the thought to be completely true? 

Are there any similar previous experiences, which I can learn from?

Court Case Drama

Imagine  you  are  a  judge  in  a  court  case.  The  defendant  is  on  trial  for  shop 
lifting. He seems very convincing stating his innocence that “I didn’t do it”. The 
prosecution has CCTV footage of the defendant stealing an item of clothing from 
the shop.

What evidence do you think the judge will use to make their decision, and what 
do you think the outcome will be?

Thought  challenging  is  also  like  being  the  judge  in  your  own  court  case.  The 
defendant  is  your  negative  automatic  thought,  for  example  “everyone  hates 
me”. When presenting the evidence that supports this, how reliable and robust 
is it? “Everyone hates me, I just know it” is that good, strong enough evidence? 
Consider  all  the  evidence  and  create  your  own  verdict  by  using  an  evidence 
based alternative thought.

Step Three: Finding an Evidence Based/Alternative Thought

Finally you need to create a new alternative thought, based on the evidence created 
at Stage 2. 

This is not about creating a positive thought, rather it is about creating a more balanced 
thought which takes into consider both sides of the evidence.

•

To create an evidence based thought write a sentence to summarise the “evidence 
for” and another sentence to summarise the “evidence against” the hot thought. 
You can use words such as ‘or’, ‘and’ or ‘but’ to link the evidence together to create 
the revised (balanced) thought.

i.e. - I failed this one job interview but I have got several jobs in the past 
I have gone for.

Rate belief in the new revised (balanced) thought

Re-rate the original emotions in light of revised (balanced) thought 

The aim of this technique is to reduce the strength of the negative emotion. The 
more you practice it the more automatic it becomes and you should be able to 
use it in the moment.

Summary of the technique

Step One: 

Identify  a  specific  situation  when  you  felt  a  certain  negative  emotional  state  (e.g. 
anxiety, depression).

Label the emotion (e.g. depressed, anxious, low, sad).

Rate the intensity of the emotion – 0-100%.

Identify the NATs that were running through your mind at the time.

Rate your belief in the thoughts (when you were in the situation) 0-100%.

Identify your ‘hot thought’. The only thought we will challenge - the one which causes 
the most emotional distress for you, normally with a belief rating of 60% or more.

Step Two:  

Identify evidence (facts) for the ‘hot’ thought.

Identify evidence (facts) against the ‘hot’ thought.

Stage Three:

Once the evidence for and against has been collected, reconsider your thought in light 
of the evidence.

Use the facts gathered in stage 3 and combine them with ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘but’ to come up 
with a more revised, balanced thought.

Rate belief in the new revised (balanced) thought.

Re-rate the emotion in light of revised (balanced) thought.

Tool 10: Create your own Wellbeing 
Blueprint

From time to time we may find ourselves going back to our old habits. For any change 
to be realistic, it takes time and effort to practice and develop our new skills. In order 
to prevent future relapse, it is a good idea to create a plan which can help you identify 
the situations which may cause difficulties in future, as well as thinking about how we 
can best manage these situations. 

Please  complete  the  following  questions  which  will  help  create  your  own  relapse 
prevention plan:
