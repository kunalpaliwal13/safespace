It's like a part of you is suddenly missing, and navigating that void can be really disorienting. Allow yourself to feel the sadness, the anger, whatever comes. It's a natural part of the healing process. Right now, be gentle with yourself. Think of it like tending to a wound. What do you need most in this moment? Comfort? Distraction? Maybe just a good cry?",,0.0

Crying is a healthy and natural way to release pent-up emotions. Think of it as your body's way of flushing out the pain. Let it flow. Don't judge yourself for it. In fact, sometimes a good cry is exactly what you need to start feeling even a tiny bit better.",,-0.1875

It's a violation of trust, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling immense pain. That kind of wound takes time to heal. It's okay to feel angry, hurt, betrayed - all of it. Don't try to push those feelings down. Let them surface and acknowledge them. You deserve to feel them. Right now, try to focus on your own strength and resilience. This doesn't define you. You are worthy of love and respect. Take a few deep breaths, and remember that you will get through this, even though it doesn't feel like it right now.",,0.0

It's okay to feel however you're feeling right now - sadness, confusion, maybe even disbelief. Grief is a complex and personal journey, and there's no right or wrong way to navigate it. Losing someone like a Granny can leave a huge hole in your life. Allow yourself the time and space to grieve, to remember her, and to feel all the emotions that come with this loss. Don't be afraid to lean on your support system - family, friends, or anyone who can offer a comforting presence. Just know that you're not alone in this.",,0.0

Grief really does feel like carrying a weight, doesn't it? It's not something you just shake off. It's understandable that you're trying, and it's also okay if trying feels like all you can manage right now. The heaviness might be a mix of sadness, missing her, and maybe even the weight of all the memories you shared. It's okay to just sit with that heaviness for a little while. You don't have to force yourself to feel better or to ""get over it."" Acknowledge the weight, be gentle with yourself, and allow yourself to feel what you need to feel. Sometimes, just acknowledging the weight is the first step in learning to carry it.",,-0.2
